Hello again fellow DEVs ðŸ¤—

As you're aware, we've been scammed by the pursuit of likes, dislikes and number of subscribers for many years now! These artificial constructs make us dance like never before in human history. And they've recently lead to burnout of many prominent **influencer**s.

This has to stop. We know better now than the Web2 era.

I've experienced first hand the phycological effects of walls of text on my own mind. In short, given enough magnitude, it leads to going bananaaaaaasss!! ðŸ˜Š Documented the feeling while I was experiencing it in the following repo:

https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/about-time

This is how I see the problem:

As the person responsible for managing a communication channel, you try to make everyone happy. You rely on facts and data points to prove a point. But the consciousnesses in that channel disagree with you! They think you're shit at your job. And on many occasions, they're right! Now you have a new data point:

> I am shit ðŸ’©ðŸ˜“

This hurts. And as you witness more data points pointing out that you're shit, you'll feel shittier and shittier.

Now if you're the problem solver type, you see this as a problem, and try to solve it! The catch is, the rate that problems are generated in a network is exponential. Your time? Linear. So what do you do?

> Unleash the GOD mode!!

You know what fuckers? I **DO KNOW** better than all of ya! Lemme slap you in the face and show how absurdly wrong you are! You start sending links left and right, get others to repent for their sins. Admit that you were wrong! Why the fuck wont you shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuup???! See what just happened?

> You became a dictator/zealot/religious shithead.

Yup, guess what, you're no god ðŸ˜‚, if anything, the opposition is more god than you because they outnumber you.

Anyhow, this vicious cycle can end today! I'd say enough debating who's the rightful god, let's move on and work on a solution.

BTW, if you want to see an example of how this process goes, my activities are publicly visible on Functionland's telegram group:
