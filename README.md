Hello again fellow DEVs ðŸ¤—

It most likely hasn't skipped your attention that, for many years now, we've been haunted by the pursuit of likes, dislikes and the number of subscribers! These artificial constructs make us dance like never before in human history. This phenomenon has recently lead to burnout of many prominent **influencer**s.

We should put an end to this insanity. We know better now than the Web2 era.

Here's how I see the problem:

As the person responsible for managing a communication channel, you try to make everyone happy. You rely on facts and data points to prove your views. But the people you're interacting with disagree! Since text can obscure the emotions, when reading comments, sometimes you get the impression that: Hmmm, they think I'm shit at what I do. On many occasions, the comments are justified! Your brain then tricks you into thinking:

> I "am" shit ðŸ’©ðŸ˜“

This hurts. And as you witness more data points pointing out that you're shit, you'll feel shittier and shittier.

Now if you're the problem solver type, you see this as a problem, and try to solve it! The catch is, the rate that problems are generated in any network setup, is exponential! Your time? Linear. Here's one way that you can go about it:

> Unleash the GOD mode!!

You know what fuckers? I **DO KNOW** better than all of ya! Lemme slap you in the face and show how absurdly wrong you are! You start showing evidences left and right, get them to repent for their sins. Admit you were wrong! Why the fuck wont you shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuup???! See what just happened?

> You became a dictator/zealot/religious shithead.

Yup, guess what, you're no god ðŸ˜‚, if anything, the opposition is more god than you because they outnumber you.

BTW, if you want to see an example of how this process goes, my activities are publicly visible on Functionland's telegram group:

I've experienced first hand the phycological effects that walls of text have on my mind. In short, given enough magnitude, it leads to going bananaaaaaasss!! ðŸ˜Š Documented the feeling while I was experiencing it in the following repo:

The good news is, this vicious cycle can end today! Lets work together on a solution.
