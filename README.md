Hello again fellow DEVs 🤗

It most likely hasn't skipped your attention that, for many years now, we've been haunted by the pursuit of likes, dislikes and the number of subscribers. These artificial constructs have become our overlords, in a way that's unprecedented in human history! The phenomenon has recently lead to [mass burnout](https://youtu.be/GQAvce3MA44) in the **influencer** community.

We should put an end to this insanity. We know better now than the Web2 era.

Here's how I see the problem:

As the person responsible for managing a communication channel, you try to make everyone happy. You rely on facts and data points to prove your views. But people disagree, it's in our nature! Since text can obscure emotions, when reading comments, sometimes you get the impression that: Hmmm, they think I'm shit at what I do. On many occasions, the comments are justified! Your brain then tricks you into thinking:

> I "am" shit 💩😓

This hurts. And as you witness more data points pointing out that you're shit, you'll feel shittier and shittier.

Now if you're the problem solver type, you see this as a problem, and try to solve it! The catch is, the rate that problems arise in any network setting is exponential! Your time? Linear. Here's one way that you may go about it:

> Unleash the GOD mode!!

You know what you imbeciles? I **DO KNOW** better than all of ya! Lemme slap you in the face and show how absurdly wrong you are! You start throwing evidences left and right, get them to repent for their sins. Admit you were wrong!

See what happened there?

> You're now a dictating/zealot/religious shithead.

Yup, guess what, you're no god 😂, if anything, the opposition has stronger god-like powers, simply because they outnumber you!

I suffered through a severe case of this syndrome recently, my activities are publicly visible in Functionland's Telegram community:

The negative effects that walls of text have on our minds are real. In short, given a big enough perceived magnitude (in the eyes of the beholder, my guess is 100+ people commenting daily is a sufficient trigger):

> It can lead to going bananaaaaaasss!! 🤪🍌

Documented my feelings while I was experiencing it in the following repo:

The good news is, this vicious cycle can end today! There's a super simple remedy.
